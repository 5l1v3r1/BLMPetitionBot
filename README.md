# ScriptsToHelpTheWorld | PetitionBot

Requirements:
- Python 3
- Geckodriver (Included within Zip)
- Firefox

The Petition Bot is currently in v1. Captcha is an issue I am not sure how to bypass entirely at the moment. Most likely will need to focus on:
  - Greater degree of "Human" looking input (Have attempted, randomized time of individual key strokes, set waits, etc.)
  - Randomize user agents (Have not attempted)
  - Mess with the viewport? (Have tried different resolution sizes no luck)
  
 Specific issue: First 3 petitions are signed fine, but after the 3rd a captcha appears for most petitions. :(
 
 Side Issue: Clean up code. I am aware it is sloppy.
